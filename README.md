# zx-spectrum

These are my Z80 assembler fun experiments for the ZX Spectrum, the best computer ever.
Programming in the assembly language makes you appreciate how it must have been back then in
the 80s. Nowadays we have great tools and environments which makes it much easier, but still
solving even simple problems in the assembly language is really challenging in many cases.
But it is real fun and that what counts.

### Developer environment
I have been using Visual Studio Code and below great extensions and tools for the development and testing:
* [ASM Code Lens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=maziac.asm-code-lens) for intellisense, syntax highlighting etc.
* [DeZog](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=maziac.dezog) for debugging
* [Z80 Instruction Set](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=maziac.z80-instruction-set)
* [Z80 Assembly meter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=theNestruo.z80-asm-meter)
* [SjASMPlus](https://github.com/sjasmplus/sjasmplus/wiki) as Z80 compiler.
